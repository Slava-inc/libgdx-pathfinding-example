# LibGDX Path-Finding example

If you came here searching for a finished game, I'm so sorry.

This project is just started.

## What is the most interesting thing about this?

Player movement. It implements Path Finding algorithm and it's smooth using
vectors.

## Future

I'm planning to make this kind of game (survival RTS) in JavaScript.

You could start your own project in **LibGDX** using this repository as a *starter
kit*.
